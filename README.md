# ts-web-starter

This is a super-simple starter repository for writing a front-end web application in TypeScript. It uses plain HTML and CSS. Nothing fancy here.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repo locally.

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:jessmartin/ts-web-starter
   ```

2. Install the dependencies.

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Rename the project in `package.json`:

   ```json
   {
      ...
      "name": "Fancy New Project",
      "description": "Something fancy about this project.",
      ...
   }
   ```

4. Run the server.

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```
